# Sequencer-Project

Current placeholder for an idea.

Using the JUCE api -> create a sequencer/arpeggiator similar to Xfer's Cthulhu.
I uploaded a PNG of what I would wnat the UI to look like, my goal is to make that happen.
By next weekend I should have a basic app running, even if its just some shapes 

I need to establish the heirarchy of classes. I need to figure out how to make the grid and how to handle audio output.
